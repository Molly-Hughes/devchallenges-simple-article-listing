## Overview

![screenshot](thumbnail.jpg)

This project was built as part of a devchallenge.io exercise to improve my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals.

**The main goals were to:**

- Practice semantic HTML elements like <article> and <time>.
- Develop a clean, visually appealing article listing layout.
- Improve my knowledge of Flexbox for layout styling.
- Focus on creating a user-friendly and responsive design.

Initially, I found the HTML and basic styling straightforward. However, setting up responsive layouts with media queries and maintaining a consistent appearance across screen sizes was more challenging. Moving forward, I plan to spend more time perfecting responsive design.

### What I learned

Throughout this challenge, I reinforced a few important concepts:

- Using the time element for making up article dates - which can benefit SEO and accessibility.
- Gained more experience working with Flexbox for dynamic layouts.
- Learned the importance of media queries for creating responsive designs, and how even simple layouts need careful attention at different screen sizes.

Although I didn't encounter many new concepts, this challenge helped solidify the basics and highlighted areas I want to improve further.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layouts
- Media queries for responsiveness
